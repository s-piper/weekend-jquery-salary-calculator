# Monthly Salary Calculator


## Description

This project tracks labor costs monthly based on employee annual salaries.  It provides a warning when monthly costs climb over a set threshold.  It's set at $20,000 for this demo.  The calculator dynamically updates the total when an employee is deleted and removes any warnings once monthly cost dip below the threshold.  Managing labor costs can be a stressful activity so the calculator has been styled with relaxing beach pastels.
